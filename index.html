                                Hey there, my name is Jake Dawson. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Physics currently looking for a job in the web-development field.
                                <br><br>In academics, I've always been most interested in STEM fields like robotics and natural sciences, though
                                throughout my years in college I've taken an interest in fields ranging from World History, to Circuits,
                                to Software Development. <br><br>After my first C++ class, I knew that the software field was the field for me.
                                After starting the program, I've had experience developing software in languages such as Java, C, C++, Ruby,
                                Scheme, and even some low-level MIPS. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class = "col-md-6 text-center my-auto">

                                Throughout college, I found the most enjoyment in web-development. Learning HTML, JavaScript, CSS, 
                                and some PHP that brings designs to life right before your eyes is one of the most satisfying areas I've come 
                                across in the whole of my journey so far. <br><br>In addition to the education received at my University, I've
                                also worked in my own time on learning how to use Node with frameworks like React to build modern websites that utilize 
                                state, hooks, and props. I've also learned to integrate backends like Firebase into these apps. Besides this, I've also 
                                dabbled with developing simple Discord bots and iOS apps, as well as learning some different web technologies like
                                Bootstrap and interesting web-dev tricks like lightboxes. <br><br>Visual design for user interfaces
                                is easily my favorite area of Computer Science so far; its a super interesting mix of art and technology that
                                is fun to develop and use.

                                Beyond academics and software in general, my biggest passions are reading in the fantasy genre,
                                all things involving the Green Bay Packers, and obsessing over anything to do with outer space. <br><br>I could talk all day
                                about some of my favorite authors' works, from Game of Thrones to the Stormlight Archive to classics like Dune! Of the Packers, I could 
                                ramble on about Packers like Reggie White (aka "The Minister of Defense!"), Donald Driver,
                                Brett Favre, Jordy Nelson, Charles Woodson, and of course Aaron Rodgers. <br><br>Hopefully, you've gleaned a good image of me from

                                Throughout my education at UWEC, I've worked on many different projects in many different languages. In C, I have experience with
                                bitshifting and checksum programs as well as compression algorithms like Huffman compression. In C++,
                                I've worked on file sending with encryption/decryption over networks and simple game-like programs that simulate disease outbreak.
                                <br><br>In Java, I've done the most work with projects like autograding software that compiles and grades student code,
                                implementing algorithms like Breadth-First-Search and Depth-First-Search, and working on code in projects for Wisconsin Public 
                                Broadcasting like Election Tracker. <br><br>In the web-sphere, I've worked on developing clean and professional front-end focused
                                projects, as well as database integration with mySQL, Firebase, and MongoDB. More projects and assignments could be mentioned, but this is a good 
                                representation of the type of work I've accomplished at UWEC and in my own time.

            ` Nobleman, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules.` + "\n" +
            ` Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: Cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it.` + "\n" +
            ` Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult.` + "\n" +
            ` Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood.` + "\n" +
            ` Unpredictable, compelling, wickedly funny, and packed with unforgettable characters, The Blade Itself is noir fantasy with a real cutting edge.`,
        2: `Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King’s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse—unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.` + "\n" +
            ` Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.`+ "\n" +
            ` Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki—whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.`,
        3: `DAY ONE: THE NAME OF THE WIND`+ "\n" +
            ` My name is Kvothe.`+ "\n" +
            ` I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.`+ "\n" +
            ` You may have heard of me.`+ "\n" +
            ` So begins a tale unequaled in fantasy literature - the story of a hero told in his own voice. It is a tale of sorrow, a tale of survival, a tale of one man’s search for meaning in his universe, and how that search, and the indomitable will that drove it, gave birth to a legend. `,
        4: `An orphan’s life is harsh - and often short - in the mysterious island city of Camorr. But young Locke Lamora dodges death and slavery, becoming a thief under the tutelage of a gifted con artist. As leader of the band of light-fingered brothers known as the Gentleman Bastards, Locke is soon infamous, fooling even the underworld’s most feared ruler. But in the shadows lurks someone still more ambitious and deadly. Faced with a bloody coup that threatens to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the enemy at his own brutal game - or die trying. `,
        5: `Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.`+ "\n" +
            ` It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.`+ "\n" +
            ` Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.`+ "\n" +
            ` Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar’s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan’s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.`,
        6: `The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, bitter infighting, and bloody confrontations with ancient and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen’s rule remains absolute, enforced by her dreaded Claw assassins. For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, their lone surviving mage, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze.`+ "\n" +
            ` However, the Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand....`+ "\n" +
            ` Conceived and written on a panoramic scale, Gardens of the Moon is epic fantasy of the highest order - an enthralling adventure by an outstanding voice.`,
        7: `Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for....`+ "\n" +
            ` When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.`+ "\n" + 
            ` A stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what is undoubtedly the grandest epic in science fiction.`,
        8: `Brandon Sanderson, fantasy's newest master tale spinner, author of the acclaimed debut Elantris, dares to turn a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails? What kind of world results when the Dark Lord is in charge? The answer will be found in the Mistborn Trilogy, a saga of surprises and magical martial-arts action that begins in Mistborn.`+ "\n" +
            ` For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the "Sliver of Infinity," reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.`+ "\n" +
            ` Kelsier "snapped" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.`+ "\n" +
            ` Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.`,
