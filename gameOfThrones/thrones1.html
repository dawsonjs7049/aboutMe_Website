        Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created
        by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song
        of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the
        first of which is A Game of Thrones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones
        has several plots and a large ensemble cast and follows several story
        arcs. One arc is about the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and follows
        a web of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties either vying
        to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it. Another
        focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty,
        who has been exiled and is plotting a return to the throne, while
        another story arc follows the Night's Watch, a brotherhood defending the
        realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the North.

      <h2>Setting</h2>
      <p>
        Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of A Song of Ice and
        Fire,[3][4] set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the
        continent of Essos. The series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles
        among the realm's noble families for the Iron Throne, while other
        families fight for independence from it. It opens with additional
        threats in the icy North and Essos in the east.[5] Showrunner David
        Benioff jokingly suggested "The Sopranos in Middle-earth" as Game of
        Thrones' tagline, referring to its intrigue-filled plot and dark tone in
        a fantasy setting of magic and dragons.[6] In a 2012 study, out of 40
        recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths
        per episode, averaging 14 deaths.[

      <h2>Themes</h2>
      <p>
        The series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of
        medieval realism.[8][9] George R.R. Martin set out to make the story
        feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less
        emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue,
        and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in
        the epic fantasy genre.[10][11][12] Martin has stated that "the true
        horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from
        ourselves."[13] A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle
        between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real
        world.[14] Just like people's capacity for good and for evil in real
        life, Martin explores the questions of redemption and character
        change.[15] The series allows the audience to view different characters
        from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies, and thus the
        supposed villains can provide their side of the story.[12][16] Benioff
        said, "George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy. He
        introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe."[12] In early
        seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main
        characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with
        developing tension among viewers.[17] In later seasons, critics pointed
        out that certain characters had developed "plot armor" to survive in
        unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating
        from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.[17]
        The series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.

      <h2>Popularity</h2>

        Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad,
        active, and international fan base. It was acclaimed by critics for its
        acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values,
        although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual
        violence) was criticized. The series received 58 Primetime Emmy Awards,
        the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015,
        2016, 2018, 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo

        established a new record for most Emmy nominations received in the same
        year by any regular series with 32, breaking the 25 years long record of
        26 nominations established by NYPD Blue in 1994; it also established
