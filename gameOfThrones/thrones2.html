        <p>
          In A Game of Thrones (1996), Ned Stark is introduced as the virtuous
          and honorable patriarch of House Stark and the father of six children.
          The moral compass of the story, he is content to remain far from
          courtly intrigues[5] and is unwavering in his view of loyalty and
          honor.[6] His family name, Stark, serves as an indication of his
          resistance to moral compromise, but his boundaries are increasingly
          tested over the course of the novel.[6] Finding himself a key player
          in the escalating political intrigue of King's Landing, Ned struggles
          as his own sense of honor draws him into corrupt goings-on at
          court.[5][6] As the story progresses, he begins to see the importance
          of moral and practical compromises to achieve a just end, and is
          ultimately forced to choose between the safety of his family and doing
          what is right.[7]
        </p>
        <p>
          Sean Bean said of the character, "he’s a good man trying to do his
          best in the middle of this corruption, he’s a fish out of water, he’s
          used to being up north in Winterfell where people are pretty straight
          and pragmatic, and he comes down to a place where people are playing
          games and backstabbing … he’s a principled man who tries to hold
          things together. This is a journey that he makes where ultimately his
          loyalty causes his downfall.
        </p>

        <h3>Jon Snow</h3>
        <img
          src="images/jonSnow.png"
          alt="picture of Jon Snow"
          class="imageLeft"
        />
        <p>
          Jon is introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones as the illegitimate son
          of Ned Stark, the honorable lord of Winterfell, an ancient fortress in
          the North of the fictional continent of Westeros. Knowing his
          prospects are limited by his status, Jon joins the Night's Watch, who
          guard the far northern borders from the wildlings who live beyond The
          Wall. As the rest of the Starks face grave adversity, Jon finds
          himself honor bound to remain with the Watch. In A Clash of Kings
          (1998), he joins a scouting party investigating the growing threat
          from the otherworldly "Others" beyond the Wall, and manages to
          infiltrate the wildlings. Jon learns of their plans to invade Westeros
          in A Storm of Swords (2000), and begins to fall in love with the
          fierce wildling woman Ygritte. He betrays them—and Ygritte—before they
          can attack, but the Night Watch's victory comes at a heavy price for
          Jon. Now the Lord Commander of the Watch, he appears briefly in 2005's
          A Feast for Crows. Jon returns as a prominent character in a A Dance
          with Dragons (2011), working to negotiate an alliance between the
          Night's Watch and the wildlings. The growing animosity he has
          attracted from among the Watch finally catches up with him, and he is
          forced to face the dire consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          David Orr of The New York Times describes Jon as "a complex,
          thoughtful and basically good character".[1] David Benioff and D. B.
          Weiss, the creators and executive producers of the television
          adaptation of the series, explain that Jon is one of several
          characters in the series who must "face hard truths about the world
          they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths" because "The
          struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip
          on who they are."[7] Ned Stark teaches all his children about
          leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's
          example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity
          as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch.[3][4] Benioff
          and Weiss note that "Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing
          that honor often gets his family members murdered."[7] Writing for
          Variety about the season 6 episode "Battle of the Bastards", Laura
          Prudom suggests that Jon "has the same shortcomings" as his father:
          "he fights with honor against opponents who are all too willing to use
          that predictable morality against him".[8]

        <h3>Arya Stark</h3>
        <img
          src="images/ayraStark.jpg"
          alt="picture of Arya Stark"
          class="imageRight"
        />
        <p>
          Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn
          Stark and is nine years old at the beginning of the book series. She
          has five siblings: an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers Bran
          and Rickon, an older sister, Sansa, and an older illegitimate
          half-brother, Jon Snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arya is left-handed and talented in sums and housekeeping, and is
          excellent at horse-riding. In contrast to her more praised sister
          Sansa, who favors activities traditionally befitting a noblewoman and
          expresses disdain for outdoor activities, Arya shows no interest in
          dancing, singing and sewing, and revels in fighting and exploring,
          much to the chagrin of her mother and household tutor Septa Mordane.
          She is described as "wolf-blooded", blunt, impulsive and "always
          difficult to tame" by her mother, and was given the nickname "Arya
          Underfoot" by the guards of Winterfell. She is particularly close to
          her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who encourages her to learn how to
          fight and gives her the smallsword Needle.[7] The sword is well suited
          to Arya's slender build and her favored "Water Dance" (fencing) style
          which emphasizes speed and agility with a thin, light rapier used in
          quick thrusting attacks. Throughout her travels, Arya displays great
          resourcefulness and cunning and also becomes increasingly ruthless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arya is the only one out of her full-siblings to inherit the Stark
          features and is said to resemble her late aunt Lyanna in both looks
          and temperament.[8] At the start of the series, she is generally
          regarded as messy and plain-looking, and often mistaken for a boy; but
          there are multiple instances in the books of her (favorable)
          comparison to the beautiful Lyanna,[8] and catching the eye of men
          later on in the series. She is also a skinchanger, capable of
          telepathically possessing her direwolf Nymeria in dreams, as well as
          psychically bonding with a street cat in Braavos.[9]

        <h3>Tyrion Lannister</h3>
        <img
          src="images/tyrionLannister.jpg"
          alt="picture of Tyrion Lanister"
          class="imageLeft"
        />
        <p>
          In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is introduced as the third and
          youngest child of wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister, the former
          Hand of the King, and Joanna Lannister, who dies giving birth to him.
          Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her
          marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime is one
          of the Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly ("for all
          the world like a gargoyle"), malformed dwarf with different colored
          eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a
          Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of
          them.[8][9] While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his
          family, he is treated as a "second class noble" because of his
          stature.[10] Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him and Tywin
          and Cersei loathe him because they blame him for her death. While
          Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, he nevertheless feels a sense of
          duty to his son, raising him in the Lannister fold and extending
          Tyrion a share of the family wealth. In contrast to Tywin and Cersei,
          Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness,
          respect, friendship and love
        </p>
        <p>
          Tyrion is intelligent, witty, well-read, and shares his father's skill
          for business and political maneuvering.[11] Grossman describes the
          character as "a bitter, cynical, high-born dwarf", calling him
          "Martin's Falstaff".[13] David Orr of The New York Times notes Tyrion
          to be "a cynic, a drinker, an outcast and conspicuously the novels'
          most intelligent presence".[3] As an outcast, he displays sympathy for
          other outcasts and the otherwise mistreated; the TV series version of
          the character commiserates with the illegitimate son of Ned Stark by
          saying, "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."[14] Still,
          he is usually seen for his deformities and vices, rather than his
          virtues and good deeds.[11] Tom Shippey of the Wall Street Journal
          points out that other characters underestimate Tyrion: "His
          dwarf-status acts as a kind of protection, because—though he is
          probably the most intelligent character in the whole cast list—no one
          takes him seriously."[15]

        <h3>Daenerys Targaryen</h3>
        <img
          src="images/daenerysT.jpg"
          alt="picture of Daenerys Targaryen"
          class="imageRight"
        />
        <p>
          Daenerys Targaryen is the daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen (also
          referred to as "The Mad King") and his sister-wife Queen Rhaella, and
          is one of the last survivors of House Targaryen.[6][7] She serves as
          the third-person narrator of 31 chapters throughout A Game of Thrones,
          A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Dance with Dragons, the
          fourth most in the series behind Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Arya
          Stark, respectively. She is the only monarch or claimant to a throne
          given point of view chapters in the novels, a choice that George R.R.
          Martin has indicated was deliberate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirteen years before the events of the series (16 in the television
          series), after her father and eldest brother Rhaegar were killed
          during Robert's Rebellion, Daenerys was born in the midst of a great
          storm, earning her the nickname "Stormborn". Rhaella died in
          childbirth, and Daenerys and her older brother Viserys were whisked
          away to Braavos by the Master of Arms of the Red Keep, Ser Willem
          Darry. Darry died when Daenerys was five years old, and she and
          Viserys spent the following years wandering the Free Cities.[6] By the
          beginning of A Game of Thrones, Daenerys and her brother have been a
          guest of Illyrio Mopatis' in Pentos for half a year. Game of Thrones
          creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff described Daenerys as a
          combination of Joan of Arc, Lawrence of Arabia, and Napoleon.

          spokes on a wheel. This one’s on top, then that one’s on top, and on
          and on it spins, crushing those on the ground. I’m not going to stop
          the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel." - Daenerys Targaryen
